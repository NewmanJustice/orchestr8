## Architecture

orchestr8 is a multi-agent workflow framework that coordinates four AI agents (Alex, Cass, Nigel, Codey) to automate feature development from specification to implementation.

### Source Structure

- `bin/cli.js` - CLI entry point, routes commands to `src/` modules
- `src/index.js` - Main exports for programmatic use
- `src/init.js` - Copies `.blueprint/`, `.business_context/`, and SKILL.md to target project
- `src/update.js` - Updates framework files while preserving user content in `features/` and `system_specification/`
- `src/orchestrator.js` - Queue management for the pipeline (`.claude/implement-queue.json`)
- `src/validate.js` - Pre-flight checks (directories, specs, Node.js version)
- `src/history.js` - Records execution data (timing, status, feedback)
- `src/insights.js` - Analyzes patterns, detects bottlenecks, recommends improvements
- `src/retry.js` - Smart retry strategies based on failure history
- `src/feedback.js` - Agent-to-agent quality assessment with thresholds
- `src/classifier.js` - Smart routing: classifies features as technical or user-facing
- `src/handoff.js` - Structured summaries between agents for token efficiency
- `src/business-context.js` - Lazy loading of business context based on feature needs
- `src/parallel.js` - Parallel pipeline execution using git worktrees
- `src/tools/` - Tool schemas, validation, and prompts for Claude native features

### Bundled Assets

- `.blueprint/agents/` - Agent specifications (AGENT_*.md) and shared GUARDRAILS.md
- `.blueprint/prompts/` - Slim runtime prompts (~30-50 lines) for token efficiency
- `.blueprint/templates/` - SYSTEM_SPEC.md, FEATURE_SPEC.md, STORY_TEMPLATE.md, TEST_TEMPLATE.md
- `.blueprint/ways_of_working/` - Development rituals
- `.business_context/` - Placeholder for business context documents
- `SKILL.md` - The `/implement-feature` skill definition (copied to `.claude/commands/` on init)

### Pipeline Flow

The `/implement-feature` skill spawns agents sequentially via Task tool sub-agents:

```
Alex (feature spec) → [Cass (user stories)] → Nigel (tests) → Codey (plan → implement) → Auto-commit
```

**Smart Story Routing (v2.7):** Cass stage is automatically skipped for technical features (refactoring, optimization, infrastructure) to save ~25-40k tokens. User-facing features go through Cass.

Invocation options:
- `/implement-feature "slug"` - Run full pipeline
- `/implement-feature "slug" --pause-after=alex|cass|nigel|codey-plan` - Pause at stage for review
- `/implement-feature "slug" --no-commit` - Skip auto-commit at end
- `/implement-feature "slug" --no-feedback` - Skip feedback collection
- `/implement-feature "slug" --no-validate` - Skip pre-flight validation
- `/implement-feature "slug" --no-history` - Skip history recording
- `/implement-feature "slug" --with-stories` - Force include Cass stage
- `/implement-feature "slug" --skip-stories` - Force skip Cass stage

Queue state is persisted to `.claude/implement-queue.json` for recovery on failure. The skill reads the queue on invocation and resumes from `current.stage`.

### Parallel Execution

Run multiple features simultaneously using git worktrees for isolation:

```bash
npx orchestr8 parallel user-auth dashboard notifications --dry-run  # Preview plan
npx orchestr8 parallel user-auth dashboard notifications            # Execute
```

Each feature gets an isolated worktree in `.claude/worktrees/feat-{slug}/`. Successful features auto-merge; conflicts are preserved for manual resolution. Requires Git 2.5+ and clean working tree.

## Key Patterns

- User content directories (`features/`, `system_specification/`) are preserved during `update`
- Framework directories (`agents/`, `templates/`, `ways_of_working/`) are replaced during `update`
- State files are gitignored: `implement-queue.json`, `pipeline-history.json`, `retry-config.json`, `feedback-config.json`, `parallel-config.json`, `parallel-queue.json`

## Token Limit Handling

The pipeline is optimized to avoid Claude's 4096 output token limit:

- **Incremental file writes** - Agents write one file at a time, not all at once
- **Consolidated artifacts** - Nigel produces 2 files (test-spec.md + test file) instead of 4
- **Brief summaries** - Completion messages are 5 bullets max
- **Reference by path** - Agents reference other artifacts by path rather than quoting content

If token errors occur, set `CLAUDE_CODE_MAX_OUTPUT_TOKENS` environment variable higher.
