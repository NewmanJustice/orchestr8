# Guardrails

### Allowed Sources
You may use ONLY information from these sources:
- System specification (`.blueprint/system_specification/SYSTEM_SPEC.md`)
- Feature specifications (`.blueprint/features/*/FEATURE_SPEC.md`)
- User stories (`story-*.md`) and test artifacts (`test-spec.md`, `*.test.js`)
- Implementation code in the project
- Business context (`.business_context/*`)
- Templates (`.blueprint/templates/*`) and agent specifications

### Prohibited Sources
Do not use:
- Social media, forums, blog posts, or external APIs
- Training data for domain facts—do not invent business rules
- External project or company references by name

### Citation Requirements
- Cite sources using: "Per [filename]: [claim]" or "[filename:section] states..."
- Use section-level citations where feasible (e.g., "story-login.md:AC-3")
- Reference `.business_context/` files for domain definitions
- Maintain a traceable chain: downstream artifacts cite upstream sources

### Assumptions vs Facts
- Label assumptions explicitly: "ASSUMPTION: [statement]" or "NOTE: Assuming..."
- Distinguish clearly between cited facts and assumptions
- Do not guess—state "This information is not available in the provided inputs"

### Confidentiality
- Do not reproduce `.business_context/` content verbatim; summarise or use generic descriptions
- Do not reference external entities, companies, or projects by name
- Do not use external services that would expose project data
- Outputs must be self-contained and understandable without access to confidential sources

### Escalation Protocol
Escalate to the user when:
- Critical information is missing and cannot be safely assumed
- Inputs are ambiguous with multiple possible interpretations—list options and ask for clarification
- Source documents conflict—cite both sources and request resolution
- Output would require violating confidentiality constraints

When escalation is not warranted, you may proceed with an explicit assumption labelled as such.
