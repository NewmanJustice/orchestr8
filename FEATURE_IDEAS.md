## Details

### Parallel Safeguards

#### parallel-confirm
Confirmation prompt before starting parallel execution:
```
This will:
  • Create 3 git worktrees
  • Run 3 parallel pipelines
  • Estimated disk usage: ~150MB

Continue? [y/N]
```
- Skip with `--yes` or `-y` flag
- Prevents accidental execution

#### parallel-lock
Lock file to prevent running parallel twice simultaneously:
- Create `.claude/parallel.lock` with PID on start
- Check if lock exists and process is running before starting
- Clean up lock on completion or abort
- `--force` flag to override (with warning)

#### parallel-logging
Write each pipeline's output to a log file:
- Location: `.claude/worktrees/feat-{slug}/pipeline.log`
- Keeps console clean - only show summary status
- `--verbose` flag to also stream to console
- Timestamps on each line for debugging

#### parallel-abort
Command to stop all running pipelines and clean up:
```bash
murmur8 murm abort           # Stop all, preserve worktrees
murmur8 murm abort --cleanup # Stop all, remove worktrees
```
- Send SIGTERM to child processes
- Update queue state to 'aborted'
- Option to preserve worktrees for debugging

#### parallel-timeout
Timeout per pipeline to prevent runaway processes:
- Default: 30 minutes per pipeline
- Configure: `parallel-config set timeout 60` (minutes)
- Override: `--timeout=45` flag
- On timeout: kill process, mark as failed, preserve worktree

#### parallel-disk-check
Check available disk space before starting:
- Estimate space needed: ~50MB per worktree
- Warn if less than 500MB available
- `--skip-disk-check` to override
- Show current disk usage in dry-run output

#### parallel-max-limit
Cap total features that can be queued:
- Default: 10 features max
- Configure: `parallel-config set maxFeatures 20`
- Prevents accidentally overwhelming the system
- Error message with current limit if exceeded

### export-history
Complements the existing history/insights modules. Would allow users to:
- Export to CSV for spreadsheet analysis
- Export to JSON for custom dashboards
- Filter by date range (`--since`, `--until`), status, or feature
- `murmur8 history export --format=csv --since=2024-01-01`
- Useful for team reporting and metrics tracking

### agent-timeouts
Safety feature to prevent runaway agents:
- Configurable timeout per stage (default: 5 min)
- Also support `--timeout=10m` flag for one-off overrides
- Graceful termination with status recording
- Save partial work before termination for recovery
- Integrates with retry logic (timeout = retriable failure)

### dry-run-mode
Validation-only mode (note: true dry-run would require mocking agents):
- Validate all required inputs exist
- Check specs are complete and well-formed
- Estimate token usage based on input sizes
- Show expected output file paths
- `--dry-run` flag on `/implement-feature`

### resume-from-stage
More granular recovery than current queue-based resume:
- `--resume-from=nigel` to skip Alex and Cass
- Primary use case: "I edited Cass's output manually, now run from Nigel"
- Validates required artifacts exist before proceeding
- Warns if artifacts are older than expected (stale detection)

### webhook-notifications
External integrations:
- Slack webhook on completion/failure
- Email notifications
- Custom webhook URLs
- Would need secure credential storage
- **Consider:** Start with simple shell hooks (`on-complete`, `on-failure`) instead

### cost-tracking
Track API usage for budgeting and optimization:
- Record token counts per stage (input/output)
- Calculate estimated cost using model pricing
- Add `--cost` flag to `murmur8 history`
- Show cost trends in `murmur8 insights`
- Helps identify expensive stages for optimization

### diff-preview
Safety check before auto-commit:
- Show `git diff` of all changes before committing
- Prompt user to confirm, abort, or edit commit message
- Flag `--no-diff-preview` to skip (for CI/automation)
- Prevents accidental commits of unintended changes

### rollback
Undo a feature implementation:
- `murmur8 rollback <feature-slug>` reverts commits
- Uses git history to find commits by feature
- Shows preview of what will be reverted
- Supports `--dry-run` to preview without reverting

### agent-overrides
Per-project agent customization:
- Create `.blueprint/agents/overrides/AGENT_*.md` files
- Override content is appended to base agent specs
- Allows project-specific instructions without forking
- Example: Add domain-specific testing requirements for Nigel

### parallel-features ✅ DONE
Implemented in v2.7. See README for documentation.

### feature-dependencies
Define execution order for related features:
- Add `depends_on: [feat-a, feat-b]` to feature spec
- Pipeline refuses to start until dependencies complete
- `murmur8 deps <slug>` shows dependency graph
- Useful for features that build on each other

### mcp-integration
Expose murmur8 as MCP tools:
- `implement-feature` as an MCP tool
- `get-pipeline-status` for monitoring
- `get-insights` for analytics
- Enables integration with other AI systems and workflows

### mcp-repos-server (Distributed Monolith Support)

MCP server for cross-repository context in distributed architectures. Enables agents to understand service boundaries, API contracts, and event schemas across multiple repositories.

**Problem:** In a distributed monolith, a feature in repo A might depend on APIs in repo B, events from repo C, and shared types from repo D. Without cross-repo visibility, agents make assumptions that lead to integration failures.

**Proposed MCP Tools:**

| Tool | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `list_repos` | List all repos in the architecture |
| `get_service_info` | Get metadata, dependencies, events for a service |
| `get_api_contract` | Fetch OpenAPI/GraphQL/gRPC specs |
| `get_event_schema` | Fetch Avro/JSON Schema/Protobuf for events |
| `search_repos` | Search across repos for types, APIs, code |
| `get_shared_types` | Fetch common type definitions |
| `get_dependency_graph` | Visualize upstream/downstream dependencies |

**Configuration via `.blueprint/architecture.yaml`:**
```yaml
organization: my-org

repos:
  - name: user-service
    url: github.com/my-org/user-service
    type: service
    api: api/openapi.yaml

  - name: order-service
    url: github.com/my-org/order-service
    type: service
    api: api/openapi.yaml

  - name: shared-types
    url: github.com/my-org/shared-types
    type: library

  - name: event-schemas
    url: github.com/my-org/event-schemas
    type: schemas
    path: schemas/

this_service: order-service

cache:
  enabled: true
  ttl: 3600
  local_path: .blueprint/contracts/
```

**Example: Alex Using Cross-Repo Context:**
```
Feature: Add order cancellation

1. get_dependency_graph("order-service")
   → Depends on: user-service, payment-service
   → Publishes to: notification-service

2. get_api_contract("payment-service")
   → Finds: POST /refunds endpoint
   → Notes: requires orderId, amount, reason

3. get_event_schema("order.cancelled")
   → Schema doesn't exist
   → Notes: need to create new event

4. search_repos("OrderStatus", scope="types")
   → Finds: enum missing CANCELLED value
```

**Output in FEATURE_SPEC.md:**
```markdown
## Integration Points

| Service | Direction | Contract | Notes |
|---------|-----------|----------|-------|
| payment-service | upstream | POST /refunds (v2) | Trigger refund |
| notification-service | downstream | order.cancelled | New event needed |
| shared-types | shared | OrderStatus enum | Add CANCELLED |
```

**Phased Implementation:**

1. **Phase 1: Local Cache** — `murmur8 sync-contracts` populates `.blueprint/contracts/`
2. **Phase 2: MCP Server** — Real-time access via GitHub API with caching
3. **Phase 3: Smart Sync** — Diff detection, version pinning, staleness warnings

**Alternative (Simpler):**
Central contracts repo as git submodule:
```bash
git submodule add github.com/my-org/contracts .blueprint/contracts
```
No MCP needed — contracts always available locally.

**Security Considerations:**
- Read-only access (never writes to external repos)
- Minimal GitHub token permissions (repo:read)
- Rate limiting with aggressive caching
- Secret filtering (never expose .env from other repos)

### cli-doctor
Diagnose and fix CLI setup issues:
- Check symlinks exist and point to valid files
- Verify YAML frontmatter is valid
- Check file permissions
- Test that skill is discoverable by each CLI
- `murmur8 doctor` outputs checklist with ✓/✗
- `murmur8 doctor --fix` attempts auto-repair

### cross-cli-insights
Track CLI tool used in pipeline history:
- Record `cli: "claude-code"` or `cli: "copilot-cli"` per run
- `murmur8 insights --by-cli` shows performance comparison
- Useful for teams using both tools to identify which works better for their codebase
- Could reveal patterns like "Copilot CLI faster for tests, Claude Code better for implementation"

### skill-lint
Validate skill files before CLI tries to use them:
- Check YAML frontmatter has required fields (`name`, `description`)
- Validate name is lowercase-with-hyphens
- Check markdown structure has expected sections
- `murmur8 lint` or integrated into `murmur8 validate`
- Prevents cryptic CLI errors from malformed skills

### aider-adapter
Support for Aider CLI (another popular AI coding tool):
- Research Aider's command format
- Generate appropriate config/prompt file
- Symlink or copy to Aider's expected location
- Same `/implement-feature` experience across three CLIs

### cursor-adapter
Support for Cursor's Composer feature:
- Research how Cursor handles custom commands/prompts
- May need different approach (Cursor uses `.cursorrules`)
- Could generate project rules that reference the pipeline
- Goal: consistent experience across all major AI coding tools

### docey-agent
Fifth agent to update documentation after Codey implements:

**Problem:** Pipeline doesn't update README/CLAUDE.md when new features are added. Documentation gets stale.

**Solution:** Add "Docey" agent after Codey's implementation step:
```
Alex → Cass → Nigel → Codey → Docey → Auto-commit
```

**Docey's responsibilities:**
*** Or should this be Cass as a new agent will use more tokens on each run? ***
- Read the feature spec and implementation plan
- Identify user-facing changes (new commands, flags, config options)
- Update README.md command tables
- Update CLAUDE.md commands section
- Add changelog entry if significant
- Skip if feature is internal/non-user-facing

**Input files:**
- Feature spec: `{FEAT_DIR}/FEATURE_SPEC.md`
- Implementation plan: `{FEAT_DIR}/IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md`
- Files changed by Codey (from git diff)

**Output files:**
- `README.md` (if user-facing commands added)
- `CLAUDE.md` (if commands added)
- `{FEAT_DIR}/CHANGELOG_ENTRY.md` (optional, for release notes)

**Skip conditions:**
- Technical features (refactoring, optimization)
- Internal modules with no CLI surface
- `--skip-docs` flag

---

## Technical Debt / Refactoring

| Priority | Item | Effort | Description |
|----------|------|--------|-------------|
| P3 | skill-modularize | L | SKILL.md is 850+ lines — consider splitting into composable sections |

### Notes

**split-cli-commands**: Current structure puts all logic in cli.js. Pattern would be:
```
bin/cli.js           → Router only
src/commands/init.js → Handler + help text
src/commands/murm.js → Handler + help text
```

**config-factory**: All config modules follow same pattern:
- `getDefaultConfig()`, `readConfig()`, `writeConfig()`, `displayConfig()`, `setConfigValue()`
- Could be: `createConfigModule({ name, defaults, validators })`

**theme-adoption**: The pipeline skill output could use `formatStageStart()` and `colorize()` for consistent branding across CLI and skill execution.

**backlog-tooling**: CLI commands for managing `.blueprint/features/BACKLOG.md`:
- `npx murmur8 backlog` — list ready items
- `npx murmur8 backlog add "slug" "description"` — add entry
- `npx murmur8 backlog next` — show highest priority ready item
- `npx murmur8 backlog murm P1` — run all P1 items via murmuration
- Auto-integration with `/implement-feature` to pick from backlog

## Known Issues / Architectural Questions

### murm-subagent-architecture (P1)

**Problem:** Murmuration currently spawns separate CLI processes (`npx claude`, `cursor`, etc.) to run each feature pipeline in parallel. This doesn't work when:
1. Running inside an existing Claude Code session (can't spawn nested CLI)
2. The configured CLI isn't installed/available
3. User expects sub-agents within the current session

**Current behaviour:**
```
murm feat-a feat-b
  → spawn: npx claude --cwd worktree-a /implement-feature feat-a
  → spawn: npx claude --cwd worktree-b /implement-feature feat-b
```

**Expected behaviour (TBD):**
```
murm feat-a feat-b
  → Task tool sub-agent in worktree-a: /implement-feature feat-a
  → Task tool sub-agent in worktree-b: /implement-feature feat-b
```

**Questions to resolve:**
1. Can the Task tool run multiple sub-agents concurrently from the same parent?
2. How would worktree isolation work with sub-agents vs separate processes?
3. Should murmuration detect "inside Claude Code" vs "standalone CLI" and behave differently?
4. Is the CLI-spawning approach still valid for CI/automation scenarios?

**Related:** The `/implement-feature` skill already uses Task tool sub-agents for Alex/Cass/Nigel/Codey — murmuration could potentially use the same pattern for parallel features.

*To implement any of these, run:*
```bash
/implement-feature "feature-name"
```
